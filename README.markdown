fleet
=====

Command an armada of processes in a cluster.

This module integrates with git using
[propagit](https://github.com/substack/propagit),
to make rolling out new code to a bunch of worker drones super simple!

install
=======

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install -g fleet
```

example
=======

In a fresh directory, start a fleet hub:

```
$ fleet hub --port=7000 --secret=beepboop
```

in another fresh directory start a drone:

```
$ fleet drone --hub=localhost:7000 --secret=beepboop
```

You can start as many drones as you want in fresh directories.

Now from a git repo, set a remote:

```
$ fleet remote add default --hub=localhost:7000 --secret=beepboop
```

Now deploy your code to all the drones:

```
$ fleet deploy
```

Deploying just checks out your commit to a fresh directory on every drone.

To run a process on the latest commit do:

```
$ fleet spawn -- node beep.js 8080
```

To see the process list across all your drones do:

```
$ fleet ps
```
